# ML Business Profit Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementing a linear regression model in PyTorch to predict store profits based on city population. It covers model training, evaluation, outlier handling, and business insights for expansion decisions.

## Key Features
- Experiments with learning rates for optimal training.
- Assessment of model generalization and overfitting.
- Analysis of outlier sensitivity.
- Strategic recommendations for business use.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-business-profit-prediction.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install torch numpy matplotlib`
3. Open the notebook: `jupyter notebook Linear_Regression_for_Business_Expansion_Predictions.ipynb`
4. Upload datasets: Place `train_large_linear_regression.txt` and `ex1data1.txt` in the same directory.

## Results Example
- Predicted profit for 80k population: ~$212k-$219k (with LR=0.05).
- See notebook for plots and full analysis.
